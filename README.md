Project 1 for 484 HTML and CSS

Site for Warhammer 40K I made with some lore and going over factions with a fun twist to the lore to not give a serious vibe.

The project goes over a quick lore dump from the beginning to the current state of Warhammer 40K. The site consists of 4 HTML files and 1 CSS file along with an assets folder where I stored the pictures for the gallery file. It completes all the assignment requirements.

Files
index.html: Home page where I go over the lore.
factions.html: Goes over all the factions and a small bit about them.
gallery.html: Shows images of what some of the factions look like in game.
contact.html: Contact demo
styles.css: Simple CSS file
assets: Holds all my images used in gallery

The three elements I used are 
  - <fieldset> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset
  - <legend> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/legend
  - <aside> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside

The three attributes I used are 
  - disabled https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled
  - autocomplete https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete
  - wrap https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea#wrap
