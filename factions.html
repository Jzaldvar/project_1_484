        <h3>Fun fact box</h3>
        <p>
            Orks believe red paint makes things go faster. In this setting belief has power,
            so yes red rides go fast. Science cries. Orks laugh.

        <h3>The Imperium of Man</h3>
        <p>
            The biggest human empire. It runs on faith, paperwork, and a very tired golden
            skeleton on a chair. If it moves, it needs a stamp. If it breathes, it needs a prayer.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Astra Militarum</strong> the guard with endless bodies and bigger tanks.</li>
            <li><strong>Adeptus Mechanicus</strong> tech priests who love machines more than friends.</li>
            <li><strong>Adeptus Custodes</strong> the golden bodyguards who never skip leg day.</li>
            <li><strong>Adepta Sororitas</strong> sisters with flamers and faith that melts armor.</li>
            <li><strong>Inquisition</strong> if they ask questions the answer is usually flame.</li>
        </ul>
