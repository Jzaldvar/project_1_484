    <h2>Warhammer 40K Fun Lore Overview</h2>

    <h3>War in Heaven</h3>
    <p>
        A long time before humans existed in the Warhammer 40K universe, the galaxy had its first
        apocalyptic war. The Old Ones (frog wizards) fought the Necrontyr (humanoids that looked like
        they’d been blasted by Chernobyl radiation) who were always sick, died young, and hated life more
        than an early 2000s emo kid. The two didn’t get along because the Old Ones refused to cure the
        Necrontyr’s sickness. So the Necrontyr called up the C’tan (giant star vampires), who turned them
        into shiny skeleton killing machines we now call Necrons.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Old Ones created the Eldar (space elves) and the Krork (orcs on steroids) to fight back.
        In the end, the Old Ones were destroyed, the C’tan were shattered into shards and imprisoned by
        the Necrons, the Eldar went off to become degenerates for millennia, and the Orks devolved into
        the dumb green menace we know today.
    </p>

    <h3>The Birth of the Emperor of Humanity (The Big E)</h3>
    <p>
        Around the year 0, the Big E was born when a bunch of ancient shamans sacrificed themselves to
        make one super psyker (think space wizard). Games Workshop retcons this origin story all the
        time, so take it with a grain of salt. He lived through human history disguised as different
        famous figures — rumored to be Jesus, Julius Caesar, and other big names.
    </p>

    <h3>The Dark Age of Technology</h3>
    <p>
        Fast forward: humans get smart, build AI, and colonize the galaxy. Then the robots pull a Skynet,
        deciding “nah, let’s just kill you instead.” Humanity barely survives and collapses into
        Mad Max-style chaos on countless worlds.
    </p>

    <h3>The Age of Strife</h3>
    <p>
        The universe decides things weren’t bad enough, so warp storms cut human worlds off from each
        other. Psykers pop up everywhere (none close to the Big E’s level) and daemons pour out of the
        Warp, which is basically hell run by Chaos gods. Humanity is hanging by a thread.
    </p>

    <h3>The Great Crusade / Rise of the Big E</h3>
    <p>
        Finally, the Big E steps into the spotlight. He becomes angry space Jesus, builds an empire, and
        decides to have some kids — twenty genetically perfect super-sons, the Primarchs. Each one
        reflects part of him. He launches the Great Crusade to unite human worlds into the Imperium. If
        you refused to join him? He made World War 2 look like a slap fight and just wiped your planet
        off the map.
    </p>

    <h3>The Horus Heresy</h3>
    <p>
        Enter the ultimate family drama. The Emperor leaves the Crusade in the hands of his sons and
        names Horus his favorite as Warmaster. While Dad secretly works on the Webway Project (to protect
        humanity from the Warp), Horus gets lured by Chaos and turns traitor. Several Primarchs side with
        him, splitting the Space Marine legions in a galaxy-wide civil war.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final showdown comes on Terra. Horus, juiced up by the Chaos gods, fights the Big E in an
        epic duel. The Emperor kills Horus but is mortally wounded. He’s locked onto the Golden Throne —
        basically life support plus lighthouse for human ships — like a rotting potato battery keeping
        the galaxy running.
    </p>

    <h3>30K–40K (The Long War)</h3>
    <p>
        The Emperor sits on his chair. The suffering never ends. Chaos Space Marines keep fighting the
        Imperium. Orks rampage endlessly. The Eldar mope about their dying race after birthing Slaanesh.
        Tyranids invade the galaxy, snacking on planets like Pringles. The Necrons wake up cranky, wreck
        stuff, and secretly wish they had bodies again because being Terminator-style robots isn’t as fun
        as it looked. Everything is awful.
    </p>

    <h3>The Current Era</h3>
    <p>
        Now we’re in the present Warhammer 40K setting. The Great Rift splits the galaxy in half with a
        mega warp storm, turning half of space into a living hell. Roboute Guilliman, Primarch of the
        Ultramarines, gets resurrected and finds the Imperium has turned into a nightmarish parody of
        everything his dad stood against. He launches the Indomitus Crusade to try to fix things.
    </p>
    <p>
        Meanwhile, the Necrons are messing with the Pariah Nexus, trying to reset the galaxy and murder
        everyone. Chaos is stronger than ever. Tyranids are still enjoying their all-you-can-eat buffet of
        planets. Humanity’s chances? Not great. But in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only
        war.
